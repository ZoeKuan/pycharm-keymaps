Personal PyCharm keymap

This is my PyCharm keymap, based on the Default PyCharm keymap.

A useful printout quick-reference guide to the default keyboard shortcuts:
https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/docs/PyCharm_ReferenceCard.pdf

To make use of this kepmap:

	cd ~/.PyCharm40/config  # On Linux
	cd ~/Library/Preferences/PyCharm2016.3/  # On OS X
	git clone https://github.com/asqui/pycharm-keymaps.git keymaps

(You may need to remove `keymaps/`, or move it away and merge it after cloning the repo.)
